Do not share your account token with anybody and keep it only in the file.

Be sure you check the parameters of the functions and the docstrings properly so you MAKE SURE you understand what the function does and how to use it, otherwise you might make a mistake. I am not responsible for any errors you might make using this library; it is provided as is with no warranty WHATSOEVER, nor am I responsible for errors that occur if Swyftx's backend changes and the program fails to communicate properly.
